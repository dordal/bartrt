BARTRT App

Development Env
Angular JS w Phonegap 3.5 & Bootstrap

STATUS 15 MARCH 2015
- fixed most bugs; added better styling, refresh on resume, etc. etc. ... app is fairly stable now
- need to update to the newest bootstrap, and probably compile a min version
- still need to do an icon and a splash screen. Maybe a dark bart map for the splash screen?
- pull to refresh? the button works for now though.
- possibly look at using bower
- on quick lookup screen, need to add a button for another quick lookup

STATUS 7 Feb 2015 - Hackathon
- all basic functionality working
- Needs styling, bug testing. See if I can figure out how to add a little color.
- Ideally would also have drag & drop sort order for stations
- Need to add loading states and automatic refresh
- pull to refresh? but would be nice if header didn't pull down
- error handling if API returns bad data
- refresh button stays white for some reason
- refresh on resume. see line 20 controllers.js for the first attempt
- need to develop an icon

STATUS 22 JUNE 2014
- Am working on the config page. 
- Basic idea is to only be able to add/remove from the list of stations on the station edit page. If you add a 
  station, it takes you to a second 'station selector' page with all the stations listed. Also you can drag to rearrange

STATUS 2 Jan 2014
- Most basic functionality works. Can load station ETD data, etc.
- Config sort of works... needs to have error checking, station deduplication, etc.
- Bootstrap is installed and working, and some basic icons, but:
  - Need to figure out how to do the config settings dialog
  - Need to add colors to the train list
  - Need to commission an icon on oDesk
  - Need to figure out the status bar on iOS7; its sort of overlapping. Tried putting some code in config.php but it didn't really do the  job properly.
  - Need to do a loading state
  - Need to figure out what happens when an error occurs
- Will need to get my own provisioning profile and iOS dev account at some point.

Launch Todo
- remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml
- switch to minified libraries

Future Features
- Add a 'to' station to filter the list of trains
- Add BART alert notifications
- automatic update feature ( every 30s or so? )

Misc
- When upgrading bootstrap, you have to compile a custom version with @grid-float-breakpoint = 0px and the space between columns = 20px instead of 30px
