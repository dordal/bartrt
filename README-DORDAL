todo checklist

X get phonegap 3.0 setup; compile apps for ios and android
X get a debug method in place ( weinre in this case )
- CSS debugging & JS debugging in browser.... need to learn more about this.

- need to do some prototype code with angular; see what I can do. 
  - data binding
  - api call to BART API
  - event handling

- Need to get topcoat installed; setup a simple UI
- need to build out app
  - tasks TBD
- need to develop icon and build actual app binary
- need to figure out how to deploy to app store



- dev strategy
 - work on getting a basic 

- station would be a model, with nested objects for time, etc.
  - name
  - abbr
  - etd
    - station[]
	    - train[]
	       - mins
	       - length

- every time you hit refresh the controller would call the API and populate each station model you have
- so maybe first thing is to get a station model, and bind the data
- then I could make things into two views, one which shows the station list and another which shows the times.
- then I'd probably want to figure out how to persist that
- then I'd want to make the API calls to BART to get the realtime data



Launch Todo
- remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml



Random Concepts

- data binding: bind the model data to the view and vice-versa. This means you don't have to constantly update crap.
- dependency injection: you have some code that figures out the dependencies for your code at runtime
