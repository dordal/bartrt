BARTRT App

Development Env
Angular JS w Phonegap 3.0 & TopCoat

STATUS 9 Oct 2013
- Most basic functionality works. Can load station ETD data, etc.
- Config sort of works... needs to have error checking, station deduplication, etc.
- Next step is to get Topcoat or Bootstrap installed. Not clear which I should use; TopCoat
  seems a little better for mobile but Bootstrap has more support and even: http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
  Dropdowns look like the hardest; there is an angular select2 library but it requires 
  jquery which I'm trying to avoid. Bootstrap has some simple drop downs.
- Also probably soon look at getting it on iOS and Android. Neither one are working right now.

Overall Todo
X get phonegap 3.0 setup; compile apps for ios and android
X get a debug method in place ( weinre in this case )
X CSS debugging & JS debugging in browser.... need to learn more about this.
X need to do some prototype code with angular; see what I can do. 
  X data binding
  X api call to BART API
  X event handling
- Need to get topcoat installed; setup a simple UI
- need to build out app
  - tasks TBD
- need to develop icon and build actual app binary
- need to figure out how to deploy to app store

Launch Todo
- remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml
- switch to minified libraries
- get a real API key, set it as a constant, etc.
