BARTRT App

Development Env
Angular JS w Phonegap 3.0 & TopCoat

STATUS 2 Jan 2014
- Most basic functionality works. Can load station ETD data, etc.
- Config sort of works... needs to have error checking, station deduplication, etc.
- Working in iOS simulator, but need to test whether I have access to the phonegap libraries; right now its just
  an angular app. A lot of people say you have to manually bootstrap angular: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15105910/angular-ng-view-routing-not-working-in-phonegap which I'm not doing, but none of the 
  deviceReady stuff is working for me anyway in this app (but does work in hello world). Not real clear 
  what is going on.
- After that, next step is to get Topcoat or Bootstrap installed. Not clear which I should use; TopCoat
  seems a little better for mobile but Bootstrap has more support and even: http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
  Dropdowns look like the hardest; there is an angular select2 library but it requires 
  jquery which I'm trying to avoid. Bootstrap has some simple drop downs.

Overall Todo
X get phonegap 3.0 setup; compile apps for ios and android
X get a debug method in place ( weinre in this case )
X CSS debugging & JS debugging in browser.... need to learn more about this.
X need to do some prototype code with angular; see what I can do. 
  X data binding
  X api call to BART API
  X event handling
- Need to get topcoat installed; setup a simple UI
- need to build out app
  - tasks TBD
- need to develop icon and build actual app binary
- need to figure out how to deploy to app store

Launch Todo
- remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml
- switch to minified libraries
- get a real API key, set it as a constant, etc.
