BARTRT App

Development Env
Angular JS w Phonegap 3.5 & Bootstrap

STATUS 7 Feb 2015 - Hackathon
- all basic functionality working
- Needs styling, bug testing
- station add feature needs de-duplication code

STATUS 22 JUNE 2014
- Am working on the config page. 
- Basic idea is to only be able to add/remove from the list of stations on the station edit page. If you add a 
  station, it takes you to a second 'station selector' page with all the stations listed. Also you can drag to rearrange

STATUS 2 Jan 2014
- Most basic functionality works. Can load station ETD data, etc.
- Config sort of works... needs to have error checking, station deduplication, etc.
- Bootstrap is installed and working, and some basic icons, but:
  - Need to figure out how to do the config settings dialog
  - Need to add colors to the train list
  - Need to commission an icon on oDesk
  - Need to figure out the status bar on iOS7; its sort of overlapping. Tried putting some code in config.php but it didn't really do the  job properly.
  - Need to do a loading state
  - Need to figure out what happens when an error occurs
- Will need to get my own provisioning profile and iOS dev account at some point.

Overall Todo
X get phonegap 3.0 setup; compile apps for ios and android
X get a debug method in place ( weinre in this case )
X CSS debugging & JS debugging in browser.... need to learn more about this.
X need to do some prototype code with angular; see what I can do. 
  X data binding
  X api call to BART API
  X event handling
X Need to get topcoat installed; setup a simple UI
- need to build out app
  - tasks TBD
- need to develop icon and build actual app binary
- need to figure out how to deploy to app store

Launch Todo
- remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml
- switch to minified libraries
- get a real API key, set it as a constant, etc.

Misc
- There could be an issue where the phonegap libraries aren't available when angular needs them. Angular doesn't wait for the phonegap 'deviceready' function to fire, so it may try to call some phonegap function before its loaded. We can probably solve this with an angular promise if it comes up; see here: https://github.com/btford/briantford.com/blob/master/jade/blog/angular-phonegap.md
- When upgrading bootstrap, you have to compile a custom version with @grid-float-breakpoint = 0px and the space between columns = 20px instead of 30px
