BARTRT App
----------

DEVELOPMENT ENV
---------------
Phonegap w/ AngularJS & Bootstrap

SETUP
0. Install iOS Dev Tools, Android Dev environment, etc., as needed.
1. Install Phonegap: npm install -g phonegap (Full details at http://phonegap.com/install/ )
2. [Optional] Install the _new_ Ripple: http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/11/05/Ripple-is-Reborn

RUNNING
Use the standard phonegap/ripple commands to build & run the app:
phonegap platform add ios
phonegap build ios -d
phonegap emulate ios -d --target="iPhone-4s"
phonegap run ios -d
ripple emulate

DEBUGGING
There are three good ways to debug the app:
- Run via ripple, and use the Chrome debug tools. Probably easiest for initial development.
- Run via the iOS simulator, or on-device, and use Safari Remote Debugging ( Develop Menu ). Also easy for initial development.
- Run via the Phonegap Developer App, using the 'phonegap serve' command. Note this only works with Phonegap > 5.X

BUILD NOTES
- When upgrading bootstrap, you have to compile a custom version with @grid-float-breakpoint = 0px and the @grid-gutter-width = 20px instead of 30px. Also turn off all the jquery includes; those aren't needed
- before launch, remember to change the <access origin="*" /> in config.xml
- also switch to minified libraries


CHANGE LOG
----------

16 JUN 2015

18 APR 2015 - 1.0.1 Release
- First release to the app store!

06 APR 2015

- Add splash screen & icon
- Updated bootstrap

15 MAR 2015
- fixed most bugs; added better styling, refresh on resume, etc. etc. ... app is fairly stable now
- Improved splash screen, but needs more work. Maybe a dark bart map for the splash screen?

7 FEB 2015 - Hackathon
- All basic functionality working
- Needs styling, bug testing. See if I can figure out how to add a little color.
- improved error handling if API returns bad data
- added refresh on resume, but not working yet. see line 20 controllers.js for the first attempt

22 JUN 2014
- Work on the config page. Basic idea is to only be able to add/remove from the list of stations on the
  station edit page. If you add a station, it takes you to a second 'station selector' page with all 
  the stations listed.

02 JAN 2014 - Initial Work
- Most basic functionality works. Can load station ETD data, etc.
- Config sort of works... needs to have error checking, station deduplication, etc.
- Bootstrap is installed and working, and some basic icons, but:
  - Need to figure out how to do the config settings dialog
  - Need to add colors to the train list
  - Need to commission an icon on oDesk
  - Need to figure out the status bar on iOS7; its sort of overlapping. Tried putting some code in config.php but it didn't really do the  job properly.
  - Need to do a loading state
  - Need to figure out what happens when an error occurs
